# Ashwin's Nixos configuration.
## Notes
* Current version of nixos-generate-config command leaves useDHCP lines commented in hardware-configuration. Uncomment these.
* secrets/ashpass.txt should be generated by using command `mkpasswd -m sha-512 > secrets/ashpass.txt`
* Install using command `nixos-install --no-root-passwd`
* Home directory should be created as needed manually. Use `mkhomedir_helper [user]`.
